* Commit messages should be a single line describing the change. Only add a paragraph with more detail if absolutely necessary. Keep commits small and focused.
* Before committing, thoroughly review all diffs to ensure there are no unnecessary changes.
* If I am consistently asking you to do something, you might suggest I add it to the AGENTS.md when it makes sense.
* IMPORTANT: The goal is to make this a production ready open source repo. All decisions should be made with that in mind. Ensure you use idiomatic Go and always question your decisions to ensure we do things in the most idiomatic way possible.
* Do not leave comments that are unnecessary and do not contribute to the readability of the code. Assume that good code is self documenting.
* All documentation must follow the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide (https://developers.google.com/style). Key points:
  - Use sentence case for headings (not title case)
  - Use active voice and present tense
  - Avoid contractions in documentation
  - Use "To [do something]:" for instructional steps
  - Use complete sentences with periods in lists
  - Avoid bold formatting for labels like "Usage:" or "Examples:"
  - Avoid marketing language and future tense (e.g., "Coming soon")
